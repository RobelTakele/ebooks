# The Geʾez Frontier Foundation eBook Archive

This repository contains out of print, and out of copyright, books whose author has also passed away and in most cases the original publishing house has also closed. Miscellaneous papers, articles, and select exerts of some texts may also be found here. 

A focus of the archive has been on early-to-mid 20th century Amharic literature.  Books in other languages using the Geʾez (Ethiopic) script can also be fond here, e.g. Tigrinya, Gurage, Tigre, Geʾez, etc.  At this time just over 125 books have been simply typed, but ***not*** carefully proofread or formatted.  In this state, the content should be suitable as text corpus for research purposes.

It is a future goal of this archive project to perform the proofreading, layout and formatting needed to publish the contents as proper eBooks.  As an OpenSource offering, the opportunity is available to anyone to publish the holdings as eBooks and even traditional paper books.  The ultimate goal of the archive is to help keep Ethiopian and Eritrean literature alive and available for futre generations.
