The "fortunes" contained here are in the Amharic language except for
"BirhaneZeray" which is in Tigrigna and "GeezQineyat" which are in
Ge'ez (AmharicQineyat are translations of ther Ge'ez counterparts).

Source files are in UTF8 and the .dat files are created by 'strfile'.
Copy to /usr/share/games/fortunes/.

The fortunes seem to choke some older versions of GNU libc.  This is my
best guess as I see garbage results when used on pre-5.1 versions of Redhat.
This is the case when the files are accessed at random.  This problem does
not occur when accessing files directly ala "fortune filename" on old 
Redhat and Slackware distributions.  Your mileage may vary...

You will of course need to be in a terminal supporting UTF8 streams and
have a Unicode font installed that has the Ethiopic positions filled.
Linux version 2.0 and later comes with 9 such fonts.

A working knowledge of Amharic and Tigrigna will also help maximize your
fortune experience :-)
